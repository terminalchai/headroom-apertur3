# Concepts

## Principal

A principal is one credential location Headroom polls: a Claude Code config directory, a Codex
`CODEX_HOME`, the Google login behind Antigravity's `agy`, or a local inference base URL. Two
Claude Code profiles on the same machine are two principals, each with its own stable id.
Antigravity's local and remote paths are two ways of reading the same principal, not two
principals.

Example: `claude-2` is the principal for `~/.claude2`, named that way by
`headroom accounts discover` because it isn't the default `~/.claude`.

## Meter

A meter is one vendor-enforced limit on a principal, addressed as `principal:meter`. Claude always
has `all`, `fable`, and `routines`, plus one `<model-slug>` meter for every other model-scoped
bucket the vendor's response happens to carry (e.g. `sonnet-5`). Codex has `main`, `spark`, and an
informational `credits` count. Antigravity has `gemini` and `claude-gpt`. A local pool has one,
`capacity`.

Example: `codex-main:spark` is the Spark-specific limit on the `codex-main` principal, separate
from `codex-main:main`.

## Window

A window is one bucket inside a meter: a kind (`rolling`, `fixed`, `count`, or `state` for local
pools), a duration in minutes, and whether the vendor enforces it (`hard`) or not (`soft`, used
only by local pools). A meter usually carries two windows, a short rolling one and a longer fixed
one that resets on a calendar boundary.

Example: `claude-main:all` carries a 300-minute rolling window (`5h` in `headroom`'s output) and a
10080-minute fixed window (`wk`).

## Observation

An observation is one sample of one window: how much is used, when it resets, when it was
fetched, which source produced it, and how much Headroom trusts it. Nothing about provenance is
inferred after the fact; a single call to a vendor endpoint can produce several observations, one
per window, each carrying its own freshness and confidence, rather than one mixed "reading" for
the whole account.

Example: an observation for `claude-main:fable` at 82% used, `resets_at` next Saturday 14:00,
`freshness: "fresh"`, `truth: "official"`.

## Freshness and UNKNOWN

Every observation is `fresh`, `stale`, `failed`, or `not_enforced`. `fresh` is a good, recent
vendor read. `stale` means the last good read is older than the staleness threshold (15 minutes by
default). `failed` means the last attempt errored, timed out, exceeded Headroom's own bounds on
the response, or -- for a vendor-reported idle window that looks like a placeholder -- contradicted
a real-usage reading Headroom already trusted for that same window within the last two hours (a
vendor cannot legitimately go from spending back to idle without a reset in between). An idle
reading that does not contradict recent history is not failed: it's shown as the vendor reported
it, marked `estimated` at reduced confidence rather than hidden behind UNKNOWN, since a real idle
window looks identical to a placeholder from a single snapshot alone. `not_enforced` is different from
the other three: it means the vendor confirmed there is no cap on this window at all (claude-main's
scoped limits), or confirmed nothing about it at all in an otherwise-successful response (Antigravity's
rolling 5h window while genuinely idle -- see issue #55) -- either way, there is no real quantity to
report and none is invented. It prints as `n/a` and never counts toward `can` or a threshold. Anything `stale` or `failed` becomes the
pace state UNKNOWN everywhere Headroom shows it, and `headroom can` answers NO for it unless you
pass `--allow-unknown`. UNKNOWN is never treated as capacity. `plan`, `gate`, and `fill` apply the
same staleness threshold before doing any of their own math: a window that is stale, failed, or
simply hasn't been polled in longer than `staleness_minutes` answers UNKNOWN by name (which window,
on which meter) instead of computing a plan line, a gate decision, or a lane count from a number
that might no longer be true.

Example: a Codex account with no 5-hour window in the vendor's response and no recent session log
shows `5h n/a`, not `5h 0%`.

A window that is `stale` or `failed` still carries `last_known`: the newest `fresh` reading of that
exact meter and window from the last 7 days, with the age of that reading, so a person or a
fail-closed orchestrator can see the trend behind an UNKNOWN instead of just the word itself --
`headroom` prints it as `UNKNOWN (reason; last 41% at 00:05, 65m ago)`, and it rides along on
`--json` and MCP's `quota_status` as `last_known: { used_percent, resets_at, observed_at,
age_seconds }` (`null` when nothing fresh exists in that window within 7 days). It is informational
only: `can`, `gate`, and `route` keep treating UNKNOWN as no capacity no matter what `last_known`
says.

## Pace states

Each enforced window gets a pace state from a straight-line burn against the time since its last
reset: HARVEST when usage is more than 10 points ahead of that line, CONSERVE when it's more than
10 points behind, NORMAL in between, FREEZE once usage passes the freeze reserve (10% of the limit
left, by default), and UNKNOWN when the observation itself is stale or failed. Right after a reset
there's a grace period, the first 10% of the window's duration by default, during which Headroom
reports NORMAL instead of computing pace off a near-empty window and calling a normal opening
burst CONSERVE.

Example: a 5-hour window that resets at 17:10 and shows 3% used at 17:15 is still in its grace
period and reports NORMAL, not HARVEST.

## Burn rate and projection

Every enforced window's `burn_percent_per_hour` is a least-squares slope fit through that window's
own fresh, same-window observations from the last 60 minutes (a shorter or longer lookback for
`headroom rate`'s own reading, `--minutes` or `--window`). Fewer than two samples in the lookback
leaves it null -- there's nothing to fit a line through yet. From that slope, `empty_in_seconds` is
how long until usage would reach 100% at the current rate, null when the rate is unknown, zero, or
negative. When `empty_in_seconds` is shorter than the time actually left until the window's own
reset, the window's pace state becomes CONSERVE regardless of what the straight-line usage-so-far
rule alone would say -- a fast recent burn is the earlier warning, catching a burst before enough
time has passed for the straight-line comparison to reflect it. The grace period still holds this
projection off during the first 10% of a window, unless the projected empty-in is itself under 30
minutes: an opening burst that is about to run the window dry right away is not what grace exists
to protect. `pace_projection_conserve` records the transition once per window per hour, so a
sustained burst logs one event, not one per poll.

Example: a 5-hour window at 22% used with a 60%/hour burn over the last few reads projects
"empty in 48m" against a reset that's 3h 12m away -- CONSERVE, reason `burning 60%/h, empty in 48m,
reset in 3h 12m`, even though 22% used against straight-line pace alone would still read NORMAL.

## Sustainable pace

`sustainable_percent_per_hour` is `remaining_percent / hours_until_reset`: the constant rate that
would spend exactly what's left, right up to the reset, with nothing wasted and nothing run out
early. It's null with no reset time. `headroom`'s status line shows it beside the live burn once
burn is known, `burn 22%/h, ok 9%/h`, so a glance says whether the current rate is running hotter
or colder than the line that would land exactly on empty at reset.

## Learned costs

A lease can carry an `action_class` (set by `lease start --class` or by `can --lease`), and every
percent point a lease's meter spends while it's the active reservation is attributed to that class.
`headroom cost [<action-class>]` reports the median spent percent, its
interquartile range, and the sample count -- one sample per ENDED lease (finished normally, or
expired), whether it ended up spending something or nothing. A lease still in progress is never
counted: it has no observed spend yet, so treating it as a sample would let a batch of just-started
jobs drag the median toward zero and inflate the sample count before any of them are actually done.
`can` uses this when the caller gives no `--expect`: it reports the learned
median as the expected cost, a sample-count confidence band (`none`/`low`/`medium`/`high`), and how
many more calls of that cost would fit in the deciding meter's remaining percent before reset.
`--lease` then reserves that expectation as a new lease under the same class, so the next `can` for
it has one more sample.

Two limits worth knowing. Vendor meters report whole percentage points, so a learned cost under a
couple of points is coarse by construction -- the median is real, but don't read false precision
into it. And attribution is an estimate, not a ledger entry: when several leases are active on the
same meter at once (several orchestrators, or several lanes under one orchestrator), a usage delta
is split across them by their expected share, not measured per-request -- exactly right when one
lease is the only one spending, an estimate with real uncertainty when several are running
concurrently. The confidence band exists because of this, not despite it.

## Per-model token share

`headroom --principal X --models` is a different kind of estimate from the meters above: a vendor
usage percentage (`claude-main:all`, `claude-main:fable`, ...) is never split by model in the
response Claude's own `/usage` endpoint returns, so Headroom cannot report "38% of this window's
usage was Fable." What it can do is read Claude Code's own local session logs
(`<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR>/projects/**/*.jsonl`, the same files Claude Code itself writes on every
turn) and sum each assistant turn's `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` by model, over the current 5h
window (the stored `<principal>:all` meter's own window when known, otherwise a flat trailing 5
hours). This is a **token share**, not a percent-of-limit: two models can burn very different
numbers of vendor quota points per token, so a 60/40 token split is not a 60/40 quota split. It is
always `estimated`, always local, and never a vendor call -- a best-effort answer to "which model
burned most of this window," not a substitute for the meters themselves.

Example: `claude-main model token share (estimated, local session logs, current 5h window from
14:32)` followed by `claude-fable-5-1  62% (12,340 in / 45,210 out)`.

## Cost model and local_preference

Every meter carries one of two cost models. Subscription meters are `sunk`: the capacity was
already paid for and expires unused at reset, so leaving it idle is a straight loss and a HARVEST
window is worth spending. Local pools are `marginal`: every request costs real energy on real
hardware, so Headroom never assumes idle local capacity should be used just because it's free of a
subscription limit. `local_preference` in `routing.toml` controls when local pools even get
considered: `fallback` (the default) offers them only once every subscription meter an action
consumes is CONSERVE or FREEZE, `prefer` offers them first for fungible work, `never` lists them
but never routes to them.

Example: with the default `fallback`, a `gemini-bulk` action stays on `antigravity:gemini` while
it's HARVEST or NORMAL, and only considers `gpu-box-vllm:capacity` once `antigravity:gemini` turns
CONSERVE.

## Consumes graph

An action class maps to the set of meters it draws from, in `routing.toml`'s `[consumes]` table.
`headroom can` and its MCP equivalent, `quota_can`, check every meter an action consumes and
refuse if any one of them can't afford it; a Fable call is blocked by a frozen `fable` meter even
if the account's overall `all` meter has room.

Example: `claude-fable = ["claude-main:all", "claude-main:fable"]` means a `claude-fable` action
needs both meters to allow it.

## Leases

A lease reserves a slice of a meter for one orchestrator before it fans out work, so a second
orchestrator asking `headroom can` at the same time sees that capacity as already spoken for
instead of double-booking it. A lease has an owner, a meter, an optional expected percent, a
time-to-live after which it expires on its own, and an end time once the orchestrator is done.
Passing `--owner` to `headroom can` excludes your own open leases from the reservation you're
checking against, so you don't get blocked by your own claim. `headroom route` applies the same
reservation: it takes `--owner` too, and reserves every OTHER owner's active lease against the
candidates it scores and ranks, so it never recommends a principal whose remaining capacity a
different orchestrator has already spoken for.

Example: `headroom lease start --owner triage-bot --meter codex-main:main --expect 15 --ttl 30m`
reserves 15 points of `codex-main:main` for 30 minutes.

`lease start` records a reservation only; it does not check whether that reservation fits. For a
new lane, use an atomic admission (`headroom gate --lease` with explicit `--need`, or
`headroom can --lease` for an action class) rather than a separate check followed by `lease start`.

## Plan line, gate and fill

`headroom plan --meter M --reserve N` splits the weekly window's remaining percent (after the
reserve) evenly across the whole 5h windows left before the weekly reset, and reports both that
per-window share and the "plan line" -- the weekly percent-per-hour that would spend the reserved
budget exactly by the reset. `headroom gate --need 5h:N [--need wk:N] --owner X` is the pre-dispatch
check a caller runs before every lane: it fails closed the same way `can` does, and with `--plan`
also requires a 5h request to fit under the plan line, not just under the reserve. With `--class`
resolving to several meters, every one of them must have a usable reading -- a meter the class
genuinely consumes but that has never produced a windowed reading fails the whole gate UNKNOWN by
name, rather than being silently skipped while a different, populated meter in the same class
answers on its own.

Add `--lease` to make that gate the reservation itself: Headroom re-evaluates the gate and creates
the lease in one SQLite transaction, returning `lease_id` only on YES. A NO creates nothing, so it
cannot be followed by a reservation from the same documented flow. `--expect` sets the reservation
amount and must be at least the largest `--need`; when omitted, that largest need is reserved.
The gate checks that reservation amount against every requested window. `--ttl` defaults to 30
minutes. A multi-meter class creates one linked lease per meter; ending the returned id ends that
group.

`policy.toml`'s `pacing` (`"even"`, the default, or `"none"`) controls two extra checks scoped to a
5h `--need` and one owner. The pro-rata line is that owner's planned share of the window (from
`--plan-share`, or their active leases plus the request) scaled by how much of the window has
elapsed; spending ahead of it by more than a small tolerance is refused even when the plain reserve
check would allow it. The burst check looks at the meter's own last-10-minutes burn independent of
any plan: more than twice the plan rate refuses with a reason naming when the line would catch up.
`pacing = "none"` skips both, leaving only the plain reserve/plan-line checks. `headroom fill --meter
M --until-reset [--lane-cost N] --owner X` answers "how many more lanes fit before this window's
unspent points are lost at reset": under even pacing it only offers the window's full remainder in
the last 45 minutes before reset, offering the pro-rata allowance instead any earlier than that. It
also lists, per `routing.toml` `[cost.<class>]` entry, how many runs of that class fit the window's
remaining points and remaining minutes (a learned median cost overrides the static config number
once samples exist).

`policy.toml`'s `[reserve]` table is a different thing from `freeze_reserve_pct`, and the two names
are easy to confuse. `freeze_reserve_pct` is a **pace** threshold: once a window's used percent
reaches `100 - freeze_reserve_pct`, that window's pace state becomes FREEZE, for every caller
equally. The `[reserve]` table is a **decision floor** per meter -- `"claude-main:fable" = 10`
protects 10% of every window of that meter, `"*"` sets the default for meters without their own
entry, and values run 0 through 90. `gate`, `fill`, `route` and `can` all treat `remaining -
reserve` (floored at 0) as the capacity they may spend: `gate` refuses a need that would cross into
it and names it in the reason, `fill` counts lanes only above it, `route` ranks with it removed and
skips a meter whose usable remaining is 0, and `can` answers NO when the expected cost would cross
it. Pace states are deliberately unaffected -- a meter inside its reserve still reports the state
its raw reading earns -- so `status` prints the reserve after the numbers (`wk 85% (reserve 10%)`)
to show why an otherwise healthy row produced a NO. Where a per-call `--reserve` (or `plan`'s and
`fill`'s equivalents) is also given, the larger of the two applies. The intended use is the meter an
orchestrator itself runs on: subagent lanes cannot then drive their own dispatcher to its wall.

Example: a burst of parallel lanes that jumps a 5h window from 1% to 23% in ten minutes trips the
burst check (well over twice a modest plan rate) even though 23% used is nowhere near the freeze
reserve -- `gate` refuses with `burst: 48 pts/h over the last 10 min, plan 4 pts/h; hold until 17:45`.

## Spend ledger

A lease says what an orchestrator *expects* to spend. The spend ledger says what the meter
*actually* moved, and who was holding it at the time. On every poll of a hard percent window,
Headroom takes the delta against the previous fresh reading of that same meter and window and
books it against the owners with an active lease on that meter, split in proportion to their
expected percents (equal shares when nobody declared one). Each row carries a confidence: 1.0 when
a single owner held the meter, 1/n while n owners overlapped, and 0.5 for the `unattributed` owner
that movement is booked to when no lease was open at all. A drop is never negative spend -- a
window whose used percent falls has reset, so nothing is written across that boundary. Rows are
kept for 30 days and pruned on the next write.

`headroom spend [--meter M] [--owner X] [--since 24h]` prints one line per owner and window;
`headroom rate --owner X` adds that owner's attributed share next to the meter's own burn. This is
the read that turns one shared account's single total into a per-orchestrator answer, so several
sessions on the same subscription can see who is actually spending it. It is attribution, not
metering: an orchestrator that never takes a lease is invisible to it, and its spend lands under
`unattributed` instead.

A budget plan is the forward-looking half of the same idea. `headroom plan import <file>` reads a
small JSON document that divides a window between sessions and turns each declared share into an
ordinary advisory lease (owner = the session id, expected percent = the share, expiring at the
window's end), so `gate --owner`, `route`, `can` and `spend` all see the agreed division without a
second reservation mechanism:

```json
{ "windows": [ { "starts_at": "2026-09-06T09:00:00Z", "ends_at": "2026-09-06T14:00:00Z",
                 "meter": "claude-main:all", "shares": { "session-a": 60, "session-b": 20 } } ] }
```

## Inbox

Orchestrators sharing an account also need to leave each other notes, which the meters cannot
carry. Each session has a directory `<HEADROOM_HOME>/inbox/<session-id>/` holding one file per
message, named `<epoch-ms>-<kind>.json` for a kind of `budget`, `note`, or `handoff`. The file is
a small envelope: `version`, `kind`, `to`, `from` (null when the sender did not name itself), `at`,
and `body` -- the sender's payload, parsed when it was JSON and kept as text otherwise.

`headroom inbox send --to <session-id> --kind <kind> (--file <path> | --text <text>)` writes one,
atomically and 0600, capped at 64 KiB. `headroom inbox --session <id> [--since <epoch-ms>]` prints
the unread ones oldest first and marks each read by renaming it with a `.read` suffix, so a
hand-off is delivered once rather than acted on twice. The MCP tool `quota_inbox` reads; it never
sends. A session id is one path segment of `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,64}` and nothing else, the directory
tree lives inside the verified Headroom home at 0700, and a file Headroom did not write is skipped
rather than guessed at.

## Events

An event is a separate, append-only record of something that happened to a principal or meter: a
reset was seen, a free reset was granted or used, a plan changed, a source started failing or
recovered, a lease started or ended. Each event carries its origin, `vendor_reported` when the
vendor said so directly or `inferred` when Headroom deduced it (for example, from a large drop in
usage between polls), a confidence score, and the observation ids that back it up. Events are
never folded into observations; a percentage and the fact that explains it are two different kinds
of record.

Example: `codex-main` shows `reset seen 14:00 (inferred, 62%)` when usage drops sharply without a
vendor-confirmed reset timestamp yet.

### Plan downgrades

When a vendor reports a paid principal changed to the free plan, Headroom records `plan_changed`,
shows the downgrade in status and the dashboard, and refuses dispatches for that principal. This
is not a normal capacity warning: do not spend a reset credit while the account is free. The
refusal ends when the vendor reports a paid plan again, or after the human explicitly confirms an
intended downgrade with `headroom ack plan <principal>`. Notifications send the initial downgrade
immediately and one unacknowledged reminder after 24 hours.

When that drop is first noticed across a gap of failed readings (a stretch of UNKNOWN rows
between the last fresh sample and the next one), Headroom does not trust the raw delta the way it
would for two readings taken back to back: a gap long enough to hide a scheduled reset always
produces a big jump once it closes, whether or not the reset actually happened during that
specific gap. Instead it checks whether the last fresh reading's own scheduled reset time falls
inside the gap. If it does, the reset is recorded at that scheduled moment, not the moment the gap
happened to close, with confidence 0.8, and a reset already on record for that same meter, window
and scheduled moment is never duplicated. If no scheduled reset falls inside the gap, nothing is
recorded and the status line carries no note; the drop is left to the ordinary free-reset check,
which still fires when the timestamp held still while usage fell.

### Unscheduled resets

A `reset_seen` fired before the window's own scheduled instant -- capacity appearing ahead of when
the vendor said it would, with no reset credit consumed -- is marked `metadata.unscheduled: true`
(and `metadata.window_minutes`, the window that reset). It changes what a human's or an
orchestrator's plan for that meter is worth: budgeting that assumed the old schedule is now stale
in the good direction. One dropped at or after the scheduled instant is an ordinary scheduled
reset, even though `resets_at` has already rolled forward onto the next cycle by the time the poll
sees it.

This stays visible longer than an ordinary reset note: `headroom` shows `reset seen 03:24
(unscheduled)` on the status row, and one line under the principal (`Unscheduled reset on
codex-main:main at 03:24: the weekly is back to 0%, plan again.`), for a flat 24 hours regardless
of the window's own duration -- a scheduled reset's own note stays bounded to about one window's
length, same as always. `gate`, `plan` and `fill` all carry a `notices` array for the same 24 hours
on any meter the call touched: `["unscheduled reset on codex-main:main at
2026-09-08T01:24:26Z; capacity appeared, re-plan"]`. The notifier gives it its own text too --
see [notifications.md](notifications.md).

### Inconsistent vendor windows

When a fresh vendor reading names a different reset time for the same meter
and window length, Headroom holds it as suspect instead of immediately
recording a reset or a reset-credit change. The new window becomes current
only after the next ordinary poll agrees; its inferred event is timestamped at
the first suspect reading. If the next poll returns to the earlier window,
both conflicting raw rows are marked `metadata.vendor_inconsistent: true`, no
reset event is recorded, and status keeps the earlier reading with a holding
note. A `vendor_inconsistent` notification is emitted at most once per meter
per six hours. Flagged rows never contribute to burn-rate or pace calculations.

## Export

`headroom export [--since 7d] [--until <iso>] [--meter M] [--principal P] [--kind
observations|events|spend|leases|all] [--format json|csv] [--out <path>]` dumps stored history for
a period rather than the live view every other command shows. Observations come back with every
column exactly as stored (no burn rate, ETA, or other field pace.ts derives at read time); spend is
the raw `spend_ledger` movement rows -- one per booked delta, each with its own `from_at`/`to_at`
-- not the per-owner totals `headroom spend` prints. `--principal` filters observations and events
(both carry a `principal_id`); leases and the spend ledger have no principal column, so it does not
narrow those two. A reason string is passed through `redact()` again on the way out, even though it
was already redacted once at insert time.

JSON is one document: `schema_version` (the number `headroom doctor` also shows, from `PRAGMA
user_version`), `exported_at`, `range` (the resolved `since`/`until` and the `meter`/`principal`
filters, `null` when not given), then one array per requested kind -- only the kinds actually asked
for appear as keys at all. It goes to stdout by default, or to `--out` if given. CSV has no single
document to hold four different shapes: `--kind all` writes one file per kind next to `--out`,
suffixed `-observations.csv`, `-events.csv`, `-spend.csv`, `-leases.csv`; a single `--kind` writes
exactly to `--out`. Every CSV field that contains a comma, a double quote, or a line break is
quoted per RFC 4180, with an embedded quote doubled. CSV always requires `--out`; there is no
stdout form of a multi-file export.

A period is bounded at 1,000,000 rows total across every kind requested -- comfortably past what a
personal quota history ever reaches, but a backstop against building an unbounded document from a
wide-open `--since`. Past that, export refuses outright and names the fix: narrow `--since`/`--until`
or add `--meter`/`--kind`.

## Database and upgrades

`headroom.db`'s shape is tracked with SQLite's own `PRAGMA user_version`, not inferred from what
tables happen to exist. Every schema change (a new table, a new column, a new index) is a numbered
migration in `src/migrations.ts`, applied in order the first time a newer Headroom opens an older
database, each inside its own transaction so a crash mid-migration leaves the database on its old,
complete version rather than a half-applied new one. Migration 1 is the baseline: the shape every
Headroom database already had before schema versions existed, so a pre-versioning database migrates
to version 1 with no changes at all, and a brand-new one gets the full shape from nothing.

Opening a database with a version newer than the running binary understands -- a downgrade, or a
database last written by a newer Headroom -- is refused outright, before a single statement runs:
the error names both versions and says to run `headroom update`. Before any migration above the
baseline runs, the whole database file is copied once to `headroom.db.bak-<version>`, named after
the version being upgraded from; if that backup already exists (a previous upgrade attempt got this
far before failing later), it is left alone rather than overwritten. `headroom doctor` prints the
database's current schema version next to the version this binary expects, so a mismatch is visible
without opening the file.

The rule for changing the schema in the future: append a new migration with the next version
number. Never edit an existing migration's body, even to fix a mistake in it -- a database that
already ran it has exactly that shape on disk, and a silently changed migration would stop
describing what such a database actually has. Fix a mistake with a follow-up migration instead.
