# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `headroom gate --lease` and MCP `quota_gate`'s `lease: true` atomically re-check a needs-based
  dispatch and create its reservations under one SQLite write lock. A refused gate returns no
  lease; an allowed one returns `lease_id`. `--expect` / `expect` records an explicit reservation
  amount (defaulting to the largest requested need) and `--ttl` / `ttl` / `ttl_ms` controls its
  lifetime.

### Changed
- Agent guidance now uses atomic gate-and-lease dispatch instead of a separate `quota_gate` then
  `quota_lease_start` sequence; the latter is documented as a manual reservation that does not
  gate. Waiting guidance now keeps a build or reset in one blocking call, rather than short
  polling turns.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- Stop the daemon crash-looping forever on a stale POSIX socket file left behind by a hard reboot or a `kill -9` (#62). Startup now probes an existing socket with a real `connect()` before falling back to the health-check RPC: `ECONNREFUSED`/`ENOENT` means nobody is listening, so the file is unlinked and a fresh socket is bound; a socket that does accept the connection is left alone, whether it turns out to be a live daemon ("already running") or one that is up but not answering health in time (a clear, unchanged error, never unlinked). A bind race between two daemons starting at once (both see the same stale file, both try to reclaim it) is re-probed on `EADDRINUSE` instead of looping. Windows named pipes are unaffected -- they have no on-disk file to go stale.
- Only unlink a path that `lstat` confirms is actually a socket; a regular file, a symlink, or anything else at the daemon's socket path is refused and left untouched.
- Stop leaking an orphaned `agy` process on every Antigravity keepalive stop (daemon restart, update, crash), reparented to init at roughly 100 MB resident each (#56). Root cause: `script`'s PTY child becomes its own session and process-group leader, so signalling only `script` never reached it. `stop()` now walks the real process tree and signals every descendant's own process group (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after a grace period), verified against a live `ps` snapshot rather than assumed from how the tree was spawned. The daemon also records the keepalive's pids on start and sweeps any leftovers a previous, uncleanly-stopped daemon left behind, matching pid, command, and start time before ever touching one -- never a user's own interactive `agy`. `headroom doctor` reports any remaining orphaned `agy` processes (ppid 1) with their combined memory and a cleanup hint. Windows, which has no `script`, is unaffected.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- Wire the Codex usage normalizer into `headroom usage import` with `--format codex`, alongside the existing default Claude parsing (`--format claude`, or no flag). Codex per-response counters (`cached_input`, `cache_write`, `reasoning`, `total`) persist to the same private `usage.db`, vendor-discriminated so Codex and Claude identities never collide. `import-status` totals show the Codex-only counters and any counter-consistency flags for a Codex group.
- Implement `headroom usage import --format auto`: a pure, per-line detector (`src/usage-format-detect.ts`) tells a Claude Code transcript line apart from a Codex CLI session-log line by structural shape, never by trusting the flag or the file's name/extension/path, and routes each line to whichever normalizer matches -- safe over a file that interleaves both vendors' lines. A line neither shape can classify falls back to the Claude normalizer and its ordinary rejection/skip handling.
- Persist Codex rate-limit observations (percent, semantic window length, reset time, parsed from `event_msg`'s `rate_limits` block) to a new `usage_rate_limit_observations` table, keyed by each observation's own content hash so a re-imported line is a no-op rather than a duplicate row. `usage.db` schema moves to v3 (v1->v3 and v2->v3 migrations, both purely additive; existing rows are never touched). Not yet surfaced in `import-status`'s own output -- read via `UsageStore.rateLimitObservations`/`rateLimitObservationCount`.

### Fixed
- Stop treating a missing Antigravity rolling 5h quota bucket as a failed read, which froze the last real reading in place until it aged into a misleading stale state even while the weekly window was fresh. A missing bucket in an otherwise-successful response is now reported honestly as not-enforced (no invented quantity, percentage, or reset), replaces the old reading immediately, shows as `5h n/a (...)` in status, and does not block a `gate --need 5h:N` check.
- Stop treating a missing Codex Spark rate-limit entry as a silent no-op that froze the meter's last real reading in place until it aged into a misleading stale state, even while the vendor's response was otherwise healthy. A missing entry in an otherwise-successful response is now reported honestly as not-enforced (no invented quantity, percentage, or reset), replaces the old reading immediately, and does not block a `gate --need` check on it -- same truth rule as Antigravity's rolling 5h window fix.
- Swift engine: classify an Antigravity window's kind (rolling vs. fixed) by its duration, matching the TypeScript adapter, instead of by whether the vendor happened to send a reset time this poll -- a genuinely idle rolling 5h window with no reset previously misclassified as fixed and could trip a held-window guard meant for real vendor changes.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Opt-in incremental Claude usage imports with `headroom usage import` and `headroom usage import-status`. Each invocation reads one explicit file with bounded batches, identity deduplication, revision handling, and conflict quarantine. Imported counters live in a private `usage.db`, separate from the quota database.
- Library-only Codex telemetry normalizer that accepts identity-bearing per-response counters, classifies cumulative streams as skipped, and parses rate-limit observations. Not yet wired into the CLI or storage.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-19

### Added
- Export a standalone browser report with `headroom dashboard --html <path>`, including meter and window selection, recorded capacity charts, sample details, and light/dark themes.

### Changed
- Show compact per-meter dashboard rows with usage bars, reset countdowns, and an optional detailed view.
- Plot remaining capacity from recorded readings in terminal and browser views; break charts across resets, missing readings, and untrusted vendor responses.

### Fixed
- Keep confirmed idle Codex windows usable when their zero-usage reset timestamps move with each poll; preserve holds for contradictory active windows and reset notification evidence.
- Stop displaying a past timestamp as the next poll time for a stale reading.
- Match quota windows by their fields, so reordered vendor JSON cannot select an older baseline and overcount attributed spend. Existing observations are supported; previously recorded ledger totals are not rewritten.
- Cancel unfinished daemon requests at the shell-completion deadline, and avoid creating database state when completing an empty installation.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- Include a universal, checksum-verified macOS native reader in npm and Homebrew packages.
- Warm agy when the daemon starts so the first scheduled poll can read local quota.
- Read Antigravity consumer quota from agy's local summary without Gemini CLI OAuth.
- Report a missing native reader and unsuccessful local reads in doctor.

### Deprecated
- Gemini CLI provider: stop discovery and polling after Google's consumer retirement.
  Existing account entries return UNKNOWN with migration guidance; history is preserved.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- `headroom update` finds the installed background service under the operating-system user home, even when Headroom stores its data elsewhere, so an upgrade restarts the running daemon.
- Homebrew synchronization waits through npm package processing with up to sixty registry checks, ten seconds apart, while still refusing mismatched release bytes immediately.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Confirmed resets reach the notification queue even when their original occurrence precedes the last delivery pass or a provider poll finishes late. Discovery tracks stored events independently of their timestamps, with queueing and discovery committed together; history retains the original timestamp.
- Shared-budget gates and lane estimates include other owners' reservations. Dispatch admission and creation of reservations happen atomically across processes, including capacity already reserved by the same owner.
- `headroom run` reserves every consumed meter, releases reservations when an executable cannot start, and bounds its captured diagnostic output.
- MCP gate validation accepts the same duration syntax as the CLI. Structured results use consistent object wrappers with or without a daemon, and the server answers `ping`.
- A fresh manual reading that raises usage takes effect immediately. Lower readings with an unexpected reset remain subject to confirmation.
- The explicit `headroom status` command accepts the same flags as the default status view.
- Homebrew synchronization retries delayed npm visibility, reports failed synchronization, supports manual repair, and reconciles npm latest every six hours.
- Updated the development test runner and its lockfile to patched versions; the full dependency audit is clean and CI checks development dependencies too.
- Public fixtures use synthetic names, package metadata omits personal author information, and source/package scans no longer exempt the author field.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Alerts no longer repeat every poll: the reset timestamp vendors report drifts by fractions of a second, and it was part of every de-duplication key. Windows now have a stable identity, thresholds advance only to higher configured levels, and no alert kind repeats for one meter and window within 6 hours.
- A message that would not tell the reader anything new is suppressed and logged.

## [0.1.0-beta.21] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- A scheduled window rollover is accepted immediately; the two-poll hold only applies to an unexpected window change.

## [0.1.0-beta.20] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- A vendor window that flips between two states no longer produces reset or free-reset events; the new window must persist for two polls, and a flip-flop is reported once as vendor-inconsistent.

## [0.1.0-beta.19] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- Projected-stall notifications fire once per window (plus one escalation when the projection gets materially worse) and only when the stall lands well before the reset; several meters of one account share one message.

## [0.1.0-beta.18] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- Dashboard scrolls with the mouse wheel and reports how many rows are below the fold.

## [0.1.0-beta.17] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- `headroom report --recovered <meter>` clears an exhausted mark by hand; a fresh reading with headroom left clears it automatically.

### Changed
- Vendor "limit reached" detection is stricter, so a transient error no longer marks a meter exhausted.
- An exhausted mark without an `until` now expires on its own instead of blocking dispatch forever.

## [0.1.0-beta.16] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- Dashboard daemon snapshots now retain their interactive request budget, and overview and new-period graph rows render local capacity, credits, and recent history correctly.

## [0.1.0-beta.15] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- Dashboard now opens with a scrollable overview, fixed-size braille charts, and configured-principal filtering.

## [0.1.0-beta.14] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- Urgent plan-downgrade alarms, dispatch refusal, restoration notices, and free-plan reset-credit warnings.

### Changed
- Documentation was brought up to date with beta.12.

## [0.1.0-beta.13] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- Dispatch guarding with `headroom run`, vendor limit reports, arbitrary vendor-reported windows, plan downgrade acknowledgement, retired-window handling, and quieter source-failure notifications.

## [0.1.0-beta.12] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- Dashboard burndowns, weekly reset markers, header art, pace glyphs and a `g` graph toggle, with local clocks, older-daemon detection and shared UNKNOWN explanations.

## [0.1.0-beta.11] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- `headroom dashboard` (alias `top`): live terminal quota bars, burn sparklines, events, leases and reserves, with cached reads, pause/verbose keys and a script-safe single-frame mode.

### Changed
- Notifications now have phone-friendly emoji messages, calm/quiet/everything presets with event overrides, and a shared picker in setup and `headroom notify configure`.
- The macOS probe reads the Claude credential through `/usr/bin/security`, which the Keychain
  item's own access list admits since Claude Code 2.1.263 stopped admitting third-party
  applications, so no Keychain dialog and no grant is involved any more: `headroom keychain grant`
  is now a check that reports whether the credential is readable, `headroom setup` has no Keychain
  step, doctor reports the credential as readable through the Apple security tool, and a marker
  left by the old probe-rebuild detection is retired on the next run rather than gating a principal
  that was never blocked.
- A `reset_seen` fired before its window's own scheduled instant, with no reset credit consumed, is
  now marked `metadata.unscheduled` (issue #20): the status row shows `reset seen HH:MM
  (unscheduled)` and the grouped view names it under the principal for a flat 24 hours regardless of
  the window's own duration, `gate`/`plan`/`fill` (CLI and MCP) carry a `notices` array for the same
  24 hours on any meter checked, and the notifier gives `reset_seen` two dedicated texts naming the
  window and whether it was scheduled -- a scheduled reset on the 5h window is held back from
  notifications by default (`notify_scheduled_short = true` opts back in), since it happens five
  times a day and is not itself unusual the way an unscheduled reset or a scheduled weekly one is.

## [0.1.0-beta.10] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- `headroom keychain grant` now always grants the exact probe binary the background daemon is
  pinned to, refusing (with a named `--use-this-build` escape hatch) rather than silently granting
  a different one when that pinned binary is gone; it prints which binary it granted, and
  `headroom doctor`'s renamed "probe binary" check now WARNs (naming both paths and the fix) when
  the CLI's own probe and the daemon's pinned probe differ and share no signing identity, instead
  of the previous INFO -- the fix for the "grant from a global install, daemon runs a checkout
  build" mismatch that left a daemon reporting "Keychain grant needed" after an operator-run grant.

## [0.1.0-beta.9] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- A windowless failed reading (`window: null`, what a Keychain grant or transport failure produces)
  now gets its `last_known` too: previously the beta.8 lookup was keyed by meter and window minutes,
  so a windowless row -- which has no window of its own -- always came back `last_known: null` even
  with a fresh reading minutes old. It now borrows the newest fresh reading from the tightest window
  of the same meter (nearest reset, when more than one qualifies) and names that window
  (`window_minutes`) in the `last_known` object, in the dense form, the grouped view and `--json`.

## [0.1.0-beta.8] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- Every UNKNOWN window (a failed or stale reading) now carries `last_known`: the newest fresh
  reading of that same meter and window from the last 7 days, with its age, in the dense form, the
  grouped view, `--json`, and MCP's `quota_status` -- informational only, `can`/`gate`/`route` still
  treat UNKNOWN as no capacity.

### Fixed
- The Claude probe is signed under one stable "Headroom Local" identity again instead of ad-hoc, so
  a macOS Keychain grant survives every rebuild: the identity is found by hash rather than by an
  ambiguous name, lives in its own keychain so `codesign` never stops on a dialog, falls back to
  ad-hoc after 30 seconds rather than hanging, honours `git config headroom.codesign-identity`
  alongside `HEADROOM_CODESIGN_IDENTITY`, can be cleared with `build-probe.sh --reset-identity`,
  and Headroom now decides a fresh grant is owed from the probe's signing identity rather than its
  SHA-256.

## [0.1.0-beta.7] - 2026-09-08

### Changed
- `headroom` on a terminal now groups meters under a per-principal header with the pace state as
  the last column, explains UNKNOWN in plain words once per principal, and ends with a summary
  footer; burn, sustainable pace, the reserve and the reset evidence move to `--verbose`/`-v`. Off
  a terminal the dense one line per meter is unchanged (also `--plain`/`--agent`, with `--human`,
  `--color` and `--no-color` as overrides), and `--json` is untouched.

### Fixed
- The Claude probe now reports a Keychain item that exists but carries no OAuth access token as
  `HEADROOM_PROBE_LOGGED_OUT`, distinct from a genuinely absent item, so `headroom doctor` and a
  poll's failure reason point at `claude` (sign back in) instead of `headroom keychain grant`
  (issue #11).
- A usage drop first noticed across a gap of failed readings is now recorded as `reset_seen` only
  when the previous fresh reading's own scheduled reset time falls inside that gap, and at that
  scheduled moment rather than the moment the gap happened to close; a reset already recorded for
  that meter, window and moment is never duplicated, and a drop with no scheduled reset in the gap
  is left to the existing free-reset check instead (issue #10).

## [0.1.0-beta.6] - 2026-09-08

## [0.1.0-beta.5] - 2026-09-06

### Added
- A versioned JSON contract for every machine reader: every `--json` CLI output that is a JSON
  object (`status`, `can`, `gate`, `plan`, `fill`, `route`, `inbox`, `lease list`, `--models`) and
  every MCP tool result that is an object now carries `contract: "1.0"` and `generated_at` (ISO
  8601) at the top level, with every existing field unchanged. `cost`, `rate`, `spend`, and
  `events` stay bare JSON arrays (no top level to add fields to) and are documented as such. New
  `headroom contract` prints the contract version and where it is documented.
  `test/json-contract.test.ts` snapshots the field shape of every output against
  `test/fixtures/json-contract/*.json` so a rename or removal fails CI. Full reference, the shared
  `freshness`/`truth`/`confidence`/`reason`/pace-state vocabulary, exit codes per command, and the
  compatibility promise: docs/json-contract.md.
- `headroom export [--since 7d] [--until <iso>] [--meter M] [--principal P] [--kind observations|events|spend|leases|all] [--format json|csv] [--out <path>]`:
  dumps stored history for a period as one JSON document (`schema_version`, `exported_at`, `range`,
  then an array per requested kind) or as CSV (one file per kind for `--kind all`, suffixed
  `-observations.csv` and so on, with RFC 4180 quoting). Observations come back with every stored
  column and no derived pace fields; spend is the raw `spend_ledger` movement rows, not the
  per-owner aggregate `headroom spend` prints. Reasons are redacted again defensively even though
  they are already redacted at insert time. JSON defaults to stdout; CSV requires `--out`. Refuses
  a range that would return more than 1,000,000 rows rather than building an unbounded document.
- `headroom statusline --render [--style compact|full] [--meters M,...] [--color]`: prints one line
  for Claude Code's own status bar after writing the usual snapshot. This session's 5h and weekly
  percentages come from the JSON Claude Code just piped in, so they are exact; the other
  principals, model-scoped meters, pace states, active leases and the protected reserve come from
  Headroom, read from the daemon under a 150ms budget with a fallback to the store and never a
  vendor call, so the line cannot delay a prompt. A pace state is shown only when it is not
  NORMAL, compact style stays under 120 characters by dropping the least important segments as a
  trailing `+N`, `--style full` adds burn and time-to-stall, and colour is ANSI only on a TTY or
  with `--color`. `--chain` still works: the chained command's output prints first, on its own
  row. See docs/quickstart.md's "Put the whole picture in the status bar".
- `headroom completion <bash|zsh|fish|pwsh>`: prints a completion script for the given shell,
  generated from the same command table `--help` reads, so top-level commands, subcommands
  (`accounts discover`, `lease start|list|end`, `keychain grant`, `inbox send`, `plan import`,
  `engine install`) and every flag stay in sync with `--help` automatically. Bash and zsh also
  complete `--meter` and `--principal` values, backed by a hidden `_complete-meters` /
  `_complete-principals` helper that reads the daemon or the local store within a 200ms budget and
  prints nothing past that rather than ever hanging a shell's Tab key. See docs/quickstart.md's
  "Shell completions".
- Homebrew tap: `brew install apertur3/tap/headroom` installs the published npm tarball on macOS
  and Linux and adds a `brew services start headroom` service that keeps the daemon running, with
  logs under `$(brew --prefix)/var/log/headroom/`. `scripts/homebrew-formula.sh` generates the
  formula from a version, a tarball URL and a sha256, and a `homebrew` job in the release workflow
  runs it after every published tag and pushes the result to `Apertur3/homebrew-tap`; without the
  `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` secret that job prints a notice and skips instead of failing the release.
- `headroom update [--notes] [--dry-run] [--yes]`: checks the npm registry for a newer
  `headroomd`, installs it by spawning `npm install -g headroomd@<version>` as an argument vector
  (never a shell string), restarts the Headroom service if one is installed, and prints the version
  the freshly installed binary reports for itself. `--notes` prints the GitHub release body before
  asking to install; `--dry-run` changes nothing. `status` and `headroom doctor` also check the
  registry (at most once every 24 hours, cached in the store) and print a one-line notice when a
  newer version is out; `update_check = false` in policy.toml turns the check and the notice off.
  Headroom never installs anything on its own -- only this explicit, human-run command does; see
  docs/quickstart.md's "Staying up to date" for why.
- Kimi: the Kimi Code CLI's own OAuth credential (`~/.kimi-code/credentials/kimi-code.json`, or the
  same path under `KIMI_CODE_HOME`) is now the preferred credential source, read against
  `api.kimi.com/coding/v1/usages`. Discovery points a `kimi` principal at it when it exists and
  falls back to the manual token file otherwise; the credential is read and never refreshed, and an
  expired one fails the reading with `run: kimi login`.
- Spend ledger: per-orchestrator attribution of what a shared meter actually moved. On every poll
  of a hard percent window, the delta against the previous fresh reading of that meter and window
  is booked to the owners holding an active lease at that moment, split in proportion to their
  expected percents (equal shares when none was declared), with the movement nobody had leased
  landing under the owner `unattributed`. Each row carries a confidence: 1.0 for a single owner,
  1/n across n overlapping owners, 0.5 for unattributed. A drop is a reset, never negative spend,
  so nothing is written across a reset boundary. Rows are kept for 30 days and pruned on the next
  write. New `headroom spend [--meter M] [--owner X] [--since 24h] [--json]` and MCP `quota_spend`;
  `headroom rate --owner X` adds that owner's attributed share next to the meter's own burn.
- Orchestrator inbox: `<HEADROOM_HOME>/inbox/<session-id>/<epoch>-<kind>.json` for hand-offs
  between sessions sharing an account, with kinds `budget`, `note` and `handoff`.
  `headroom inbox send --to <session-id> --kind <kind> (--file <path> | --text <text>)` writes one
  atomically at 0600, capped at 64 KiB; `headroom inbox --session <id> [--since <epoch-ms>]` prints
  the unread ones oldest first and marks each read by renaming it with a `.read` suffix, so a
  hand-off is delivered once. MCP `quota_inbox` reads and never sends. Session ids are one path
  segment of `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,64}`, directory references and traversal are refused, and the tree
  is created 0700 inside the verified Headroom home.
- `headroom plan import <file>`: a budget plan (`{ "windows": [ { "starts_at", "ends_at", "meter",
  "shares": { "<session>": <percent> } } ] }`) becomes one advisory lease per share, owned by the
  session id and expiring at the window's end, so `gate --owner`, `route`, `can` and `spend` see the
  agreed division without a second reservation mechanism. Windows that have already ended are
  skipped.
- Notifications for humans. A `[notify]` block in policy.toml delivers stored events (resets, free
  resets, source failures and recoveries, projected stalls, `model_new`) plus a `threshold_percent`
  crossing to Telegram, ntfy, or a webhook, from the daemon after each poll. A per-event ledger in
  the store means nothing is ever sent twice, quiet hours batch a night's events into one message,
  and a failing channel is retried at most three times per event. Telegram's bot token and the
  optional webhook bearer are read from the OS secret store at send time (macOS Keychain,
  `secret-tool` on Linux, Credential Manager on Windows) and never from a file; without a store the
  channel is disabled with a reason instead of falling back to plaintext. Every call goes through
  the existing outbound guard with the channel's own host allowlisted, redirects refused, the
  response capped and a 5-second timeout. New commands: `headroom notify --test` and
  `headroom notify --last <n>`. See docs/notifications.md.
- `model_new` event: a vendor reporting a bucket name Headroom has never seen for a principal it
  already reads (Claude's `limits[]` display names are stored as meters), so a new model release
  surfaces as an event and, with notifications on, as a message.
- Native Gemini CLI adapter (vendor `gemini`, the Gemini Code Assist subscription). It reads
  `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` (or the `.gemini` under a `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` override), refreshes the
  token in memory, and calls `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:loadCodeAssist` with the Gemini
  CLI's own `ideType: "GEMINI_CLI"` metadata followed by `v1internal:retrieveUserQuota`. Meters are
  `<principal>:<model family>` per quota bucket (plus `<principal>:all` for an unscoped bucket),
  with `used` computed as `(1 - remainingFraction) * 100` and the lowest fraction winning when a
  family reports several token types. A tier without quota entitlement answers 403: that becomes a
  `failed` reading with reason "quota endpoint not permitted for this account tier (403)", inside
  the shared protected-status backoff rather than an exception, and a missing Code Assist project
  reports "no Code Assist project; finish setup in the Gemini CLI" instead of onboarding one.
  `accounts discover` adds the principal (`gemini`, or `gemini-<home basename>` for a
  `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` override) and `doctor` reports its credential file like the other vendors.
- The Gemini CLI OAuth credential read, in-memory token refresh, bundled OAuth client discovery and
  both Code Assist calls now live in one shared module (`src/adapters/google-code-assist.ts`) that
  the Antigravity and Gemini adapters both import, with no behaviour change to the Antigravity path.
- Native Kimi adapter (vendor `kimi`, Moonshot's Kimi app and CLI). It reads the subscription
  allowance from `www.kimi.com/apiv2` (`kimi.gateway.billing.v1.BillingService/GetUsages`, plus the
  membership plan and subscription-stats calls) and emits `<principal>:main` (allowance window and
  the rate-limit window the response declares), `<principal>:total` (the shared subscription pool)
  and `<principal>:code-7d` (the membership 7-day Code ratio, only when it diverges from the
  allowance). Kimi has no credential file Headroom is willing to read on its own, since the desktop
  app keeps its session token in a browser cookie store, so `location` names a 0600 token file you
  write yourself (default `~/.kimi/auth.token`); `accounts discover` picks it up and `doctor`
  reports its presence and permissions. An optional `moonshot.key` file beside it adds an
  informational `<principal>:credits` meter from the Moonshot platform balance. `www.kimi.com` and
  `api.moonshot.ai` are on the outbound allowlist; the token stays in memory and is never logged.
- `headroom usage --paste` (stdin) and `headroom usage --clipboard` (macOS `pbpaste`, Linux `xclip`
  or `wl-paste`, Windows `Get-Clipboard`) turn the text of Claude Code's `/usage` panel into
  observations, for the case where a meter exists but cannot be polled: the session line maps to
  `<principal>:all` over 5h, the all-models week to `<principal>:all` over a week, and a scoped week
  line (`Fable`, `Sonnet only`, and so on) to `<principal>:<model-slug>`, slugged exactly the way the
  Claude adapter slugs the vendor's own `limits[]` display names. The parser tolerates bars, box
  drawing, ragged spacing, `12%` or `12% used`, and resets given relatively (`in 2h 14m`), absolutely
  (`Sep 13, 2:00pm`, `at 14:00`, `Sat 09:30`) or not at all. Readings are stored with `source: "paste"`,
  `truth: "official"` and confidence 0.9 through the same insert as a poll, so events, pace states,
  `gate`, `can`, `rate` and `route` see them at once, and the next poll supersedes them by being newer.
  One line is printed per ingested window, a warning per panel line that could not be read, exit 0 when
  at least one window landed and 1 otherwise; `--json` prints the stored observations. The same is
  available over MCP as `quota_usage_paste` (`{ principal?, text }`).
- A protected reserve per meter, set in `policy.toml`'s new `[reserve]` table (`"claude-main:fable" = 10`
  reserves 10 percent of every window of that meter; `"*"` is the default for meters without their own
  entry; values run 0 through 90, and anything else is a policy error `doctor` reports). `gate`, `fill`,
  `route` and `can` all treat `remaining - reserve` (floored at 0) as the capacity they may spend: `gate`
  refuses a need that would cross into it and names it in the reason, `fill` counts lanes only above it,
  `route` ranks with it removed and skips a meter whose usable remaining is 0, and `can` answers NO when
  the expected cost would cross it. `plan` draws its line above it too. Where a per-call `--reserve` is
  also given, the larger of the two applies. Pace states are unchanged, so `status` now prints the
  reserve after a window's numbers (`wk 85% (reserve 10%)`) to show why an otherwise healthy row
  produced a NO. The MCP twins (`quota_gate`, `quota_fill`, `quota_route`, `quota_can`) apply the same
  floor. Intended for the meter an orchestrator itself runs on, so subagent lanes cannot drive their own
  dispatcher to its weekly wall.
- Native Grok adapter (vendor `grok`) for the subscription the Grok CLI signs into. It reads the token
  `grok login` writes to `<GROK_HOME>/auth.json` (default `~/.grok/auth.json`, a regular file owned by
  you, read in memory only and never logged) and calls the CLI chat proxy:
  `/v1/billing?format=credits` for usage and `/v1/settings` for the plan name, the latter as optional
  enrichment that never fails the read. Meters: `<principal>:main`, the allowance percent with the
  window length and reset taken from the published billing period, and `<principal>:credits`, the
  on-demand balance as an informational `count` window. `accounts discover` adds the principal once the
  token file exists, `doctor` reports its presence, a 401 says "run: grok login", and 403/429 keep the
  status the collector backs off on. The browser-cookie fallback is deliberately not implemented: see
  docs/vendors.md.
- `headroom uninstall [--home] [--yes] [--dry-run]`: reverses `setup` in order -- stops and removes
  the background service, removes the Claude Code MCP registration for every configured profile that
  has one (`claude mcp remove headroom`, with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set for a non-default profile), and
  with `--home` deletes the Headroom home directory (database, logs, config, and accounts.toml) after
  a y/N question `--yes` answers. Always ends by printing `npm uninstall -g headroomd` for the user to
  run themselves -- Headroom never removes its own package while running. `--dry-run` prints the plan
  and changes nothing; exits 0 on success or nothing to do, 1 when a step failed.
- `headroom doctor --bundle [path]`: writes one redacted, human-readable text file
  (`headroom-bundle-<date>.txt` in the current directory by default) for pasting into a GitHub
  issue, and prints its path and size. Holds the Headroom and Node versions, OS and arch, the
  running binary's path, the same lines `headroom doctor` prints, configured principals (vendor
  and adapter only, never a location), the policy and routing config, the last 50 lines of the
  daemon log, the last 20 audit rows, and the current status lines. A single redaction pass over
  the whole file removes token and credential shapes, email addresses, private network addresses,
  this machine's hostname, home directory and username before anything is written; never includes
  accounts.toml's own location, the database, or a credential file. Never polls a vendor.

### Fixed
- Burn rate: a lookback window spanning a reset (weekly or free) no longer pairs a near-full
  pre-reset sample with a near-empty post-reset one and reports a wildly negative rate (issue #7,
  e.g. `-113%/h`). `store.burnRateFor` now cuts a window's samples off at its most recent reset
  (the confirmed `reset_seen` event, or the same raw usage-drop rule when no event was recorded),
  so `rate`, the status line's burn segment, and the burn-driven projection into CONSERVE all read
  only the post-reset slope; with fewer than two samples since the reset, burn is null instead of
  negative, and a small negative slope left over from whole-percent rounding noise is clamped to 0.
- Daemon log rotation (`daemon.log` capped at 5 MiB, shifting into `.1`..`.4` before every write,
  rename-before-create so a concurrent `headroom logs --tail` never sees a half-rotated file) is now
  covered by tests for the full shift chain, the mode-0600 new file, and a tail racing the rotation,
  and documented in the quickstart alongside the one path Headroom cannot rotate itself: the OS-level
  stdout/stderr redirect the service definitions also point at that file.
- The SQLite store had no schema version: `open()` ran `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and ad hoc
  `ALTER TABLE` for every table on every start, so a shape change could apply silently out of order
  and a downgrade could open a newer database without noticing. `headroom.db` now tracks its shape
  with `PRAGMA user_version`, applied through numbered migrations in new `src/migrations.ts`
  (migration 1 is the exact previous shape, so an existing database migrates to it with no changes),
  each run inside its own transaction with the version bumped only on success. A database newer than
  the running binary understands is refused outright, before any statement runs, naming both versions
  and `headroom update`. Before any migration above the baseline runs, the database file is backed up
  once to `headroom.db.bak-<version>`. `headroom doctor` prints the database's schema version next to
  the version this binary expects.

## [0.1.0-beta.4] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed
- A fresh statusline snapshot no longer skips a granted Claude probe, so the model-scoped meters (Fable, Routines) update every poll; the snapshot is the fallback for the account-wide windows when the probe is blocked or fails.
- Windows named pipe: the daemon only ever authenticated the client, not itself. Because the pipe
  namespace is machine-global, another local process (including one running as a different user)
  could squat the pipe name before the real daemon started and answer requests with forged results;
  `health`'s static signature made this worse since it could be captured once from a real daemon and
  replayed forever. The client now verifies a per-connection proof on every reply, including
  `health`'s, and treats a missing or wrong one exactly like no daemon answering at all. POSIX is
  unaffected.
- Claude statusline snapshots: every configured snapshot directory and file is now trust-checked
  before being read -- safe ancestry, no symlinks, not foreign-owned or writable by group/other --
  with an unsafe directory skipped (one line to stderr) rather than read, and each file bounded to
  64 KiB, 64 files per directory, and a shallow JSON depth. A snapshot timestamp outside
  JavaScript's `Date` range or more than five minutes in the future is now rejected outright instead
  of winning newest-snapshot selection forever or crashing the reader, and a malformed reset no
  longer aborts an otherwise-valid snapshot. `headroom statusline` now resolves and verifies the
  same safe Headroom home and statusline directory every other command uses before writing, and
  writes each snapshot through a temporary file renamed into place, refusing to write through an
  existing symlink at the destination rather than following it.
- Windows named pipe, second pass: the mutual-auth proof above only ever covered the two nonces, so
  a live process relaying a genuine handshake to the real daemon could still ask it for an
  unauthenticated answer to some request and hand a different result back to the waiting client
  with that same, still-valid proof attached. The proof now also binds the exact request and reply
  bytes exchanged on the connection (SHA-256 hashes of both, sent as their own line right after the
  reply), so substituting either one fails verification. Separately, the daemon and a client could
  select two different pipe names for the same Headroom home when it was spelled differently
  (trailing separator, letter case, `.`/`..` components); both now canonicalize through one
  function first. The connection cap could also be held open indefinitely by a connection that
  never completed the handshake, or made to buffer unbounded work from one connection sending many
  requests without waiting for a reply; a pipe connection is now closed if it does not authenticate
  within 5 seconds, closed after 30 seconds of inactivity, limited to one request in flight at a
  time, and never left to buffer unlimited unwritten output. The client-side pipe reader is now
  bounded too: a nonce frame must be exactly 32 lowercase hex characters, a response over 256 KiB
  is treated as unresponsive, and every request has a 10-second absolute deadline in addition to
  its existing inactivity timeout. POSIX is unaffected throughout.
- `rate`, `plan`, `gate` and `fill` now apply the same staleness/age gate `can` and `route` already
  did before scoring a pace state: a window that is stale, failed, or older than
  `staleness_minutes` answers UNKNOWN by name instead of computing a plan line, a gate decision, or
  a lane count off a reading that might no longer be true. `gate` with `--class`/`--meter`
  resolving to several meters also no longer silently skips a meter that has never produced a
  windowed reading at all while a different, populated meter in the same class answers YES on its
  own -- that now fails the whole gate UNKNOWN, naming the unread meter.
- All thirteen MCP tools now validate their arguments against the tool's own declared schema
  before any dispatch, to the daemon or to the direct fallback: a wrong type, a number outside the
  same bounds the CLI enforces (`reserve_percent`/`expected_percent` 0-100, `plan_share_percent`
  >= 0, `lane_cost_percent`/`ttl_ms`/`minutes` > 0), or an argument name the tool never declared is
  now refused as a JSON-RPC invalid-params error naming the argument, instead of being coerced,
  silently dropped, or ignored. `quota_gate`'s `needs` array is rejected as a whole the moment one
  entry is not a valid `"5h:N"`/`"wk:N"` string, rather than quietly gating on only the valid
  entries. `quota_lease_start`'s direct (no-daemon) fallback also now preserves a supplied
  `action_class`, which it previously dropped.
- `headroom route` (and `quota_route`) now reserves every OTHER owner's active lease against the
  same meters before scoring and ranking a candidate, the same reservation `can`/`quota_can`
  already applied -- it no longer recommends a principal whose remaining capacity a different
  orchestrator has already reserved.
- Learned costs (`headroom cost`, `can`'s expected-cost report, `fill`'s fallback lane cost) now
  train only on leases that have ended or expired; an in-progress lease is no longer counted as a
  zero-cost sample. A batch of just-started jobs can no longer drag the median toward zero and
  inflate the sample count before any of them are actually done. A completed lease with genuinely
  no spend still counts as one real zero-cost sample.
- `headroom setup --dry-run`, and the implicit non-TTY plan, described the doctor and final-check
  steps instead of running them: neither ever opens the Headroom home database, performs a
  Keychain lookup, or polls a vendor while planning, and an empty temporary home now stays empty
  through the whole plan. An empty answer to any setup prompt is now treated as No, matching the
  displayed `[y/N]`, instead of as Yes.
- Antigravity: a remote usage read or `--shape` with no resolvable Code Assist project no longer
  provisions one. The `onboardUser` call, which silently POSTed a selected billing tier under
  credentials supplied only for reading usage and could swallow a protected vendor status (401,
  403, 429) in the process, is removed entirely; a missing project now comes back as a normal
  failed reading with reason "no Code Assist project; finish setup in the Gemini CLI".
- The release workflow's manual re-publish no longer interpolates the dispatched tag directly into
  a shell script; it is passed through an environment variable, checked against the release-tag
  grammar before use, and the downloaded release asset's own `package.json` version must match the
  tag or the workflow refuses to publish.
- Gemini OAuth client discovery and the Antigravity keepalive's log reader now require a regular
  file (never a symlink) everywhere they read one, including the environment-override and
  PATH-derived candidates; discovery is bounded to 16 MiB and 200 files per attempt, and the
  keepalive reads only the last 64 KiB of the newest log rather than the whole (possibly still
  growing) file. An oversized or otherwise unsafe candidate is treated as unavailable, and two log
  samples from the same supervisor can no longer overlap.
- `scripts/privacy-sweep.sh --check` no longer reports a clean pass for a missing or unreadable
  input, and neither privacy script can silently read a grep failure, an invalid denylist regular
  expression, or an unreadable file as "no hits" -- each is now a hard scan error that fails the
  run on its own. `public-audit.sh` now reads tracked filenames NUL-delimited throughout, so a
  filename with a space or a quote can no longer be split or dropped. The CGNAT check in
  `privacy-sweep.sh` now covers the RFC 6598 second-octet range (64 through 127) instead of only
  the /16 whose second octet is literally 64.
- `scripts/build-probe.sh` no longer writes an unencrypted private key to a fixed-password PKCS#12
  file: the key is generated in a mode-0700 temporary directory, exported and imported under a
  random password generated fresh for that one run and held only in memory, imported for
  `codesign` alone (never every application), and the private key and PKCS#12 bundle are shredded
  immediately after import -- including under `HEADROOM_BUILD_PROBE_KEEP_WORKDIR`, which now keeps
  only the certificate and openssl config it exists to let a test inspect.

## [0.1.0-beta.3] - 2026-09-06

### Added
- `headroom setup`: a one-shot interactive setup for a person without an agent. Walks through
  account discovery, `doctor`, the macOS Keychain grant, the background service install and the
  MCP registration, printing each step before it runs and asking a yes/no question before
  anything that changes something. `--dry-run` shows the full plan without changing anything;
  `--yes` answers yes to every step except the Keychain grant, which it never runs on its own --
  it prints the command to run by hand instead; `--skip-service` and `--skip-mcp` leave those
  steps out. With no TTY on stdin and no `--yes`, it prints the plan and exits 0 instead of
  blocking on a question a script cannot answer. Replaces sections 2-7 of the quickstart for
  anyone who would rather run one command than read the walkthrough.

### Changed
- Antigravity: a daemon-kept `agy` local quota summary reporting an idle window (0% or unknown
  usage, reset equal to fetch time plus window length) is now shown with its vendor-reported
  numbers and a doubt marker (`truth: "estimated"`, halved confidence, `(idle, unverified)` in
  `headroom` status) instead of being replaced with UNKNOWN on a heuristic. It is only demoted to a
  real failure when the store's own history contradicts it -- a fresh reading for the same meter
  and window within the last 2 hours already showed real usage whose reset has not yet passed. An
  availability-only payload (no vendor bucket carries a `remainingFraction` at all) is unchanged:
  still reported UNKNOWN, since there is no number to show.

## [0.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- `headroom statusline`: a zero-auth Claude source. Register it as Claude Code's own `statusLine`
  command and Headroom reads the same JSON Claude Code already renders every prompt instead of
  ever touching the Keychain, with `--chain` to keep an existing statusLine command's own output.
  Also reads an existing collector's `state/<alias>.json` shape, configurable via
  `policy.toml`'s `statusline_snapshot_dirs`.
- `headroom route --class <action-class> --owner X`: picks the principal with the most remaining
  headroom in the tightest window among the routing entry's allowed principals of one vendor, and
  prints its launch environment (e.g. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude2`); exit 2 when none fits.
- `headroom --principal <id> --models`: a best-effort local estimate of per-model token share over
  the current 5h window, read from Claude Code's own session logs.
- `headroom --refresh` (and `--ttl 0`): forces a fresh poll through the daemon, respecting the
  grant marker and the daemon's own vendor backoff.
- `headroom version` / `headroom --version`.
- A scoped Claude meter (Fable, Routines, or any other model-scoped bucket the vendor's response
  carries) that has a percent is never dropped just because the vendor flags it inactive; it is now
  reported as a real, soft-enforced window instead of `n/a`. Every other model-scoped bucket gets
  its own `<principal>:<model-slug>` meter. `gate --model <slug>` answers against it.
- `doctor` prints the Headroom version and which configured Claude profiles have the MCP server
  registered.
- `scripts/build-probe.sh` signs the Claude probe with a stable local identity ("Headroom Local",
  created once in the login keychain) instead of ad-hoc, so a `headroom keychain grant` survives
  every later probe rebuild -- previously every `npm pack`, `release:check`, or global reinstall
  produced a brand-new, unrecognized signing identity and re-triggered the Keychain dialog. Only
  rebuilds the probe when its own source has actually changed. Headroom pins the exact probe binary
  a grant succeeded under (recorded per Headroom home) and always uses that one; `doctor` reports
  when a second, unused candidate binary exists instead of silently switching to it.

- Antigravity reads Google's own quota endpoint first (token refresh, `loadCodeAssist`, onboarding
  when the account has no project yet, `retrieveUserQuota`) with the Gemini CLI's stored OAuth
  credentials, finds the OAuth client in a Homebrew-installed `gemini-cli` too, and starts the
  local `agy` keepalive only when the remote path falls short. `--principal <name> --shape` shows
  the response shapes, the account tier and a denial reason, so a free-tier 403 is diagnosable.
- `scripts/public-audit.sh` runs in CI: tracked archives, commit identities, personal-data
  patterns, process residue and an optional untracked denylist across files and history.

### Fixed
- The local signing identity could not be imported on current macOS (PKCS12 MAC verification
  failure) and an imported one was never recognized because the check filtered on a trust chain a
  self-signed certificate never has; both fixed, so the identity is created once and reused.
- `keychain grant` and `doctor` distinguish a Keychain dialog that cannot be shown from this shell
  (macOS `errSecInteractionNotAllowed` / a cancelled interaction) from a config directory with no
  Claude Code login at all -- the former no longer misreports as "no login".
- `can`'s printed reason for an UNKNOWN meter no longer nests the window state twice.
- A vendor 429 backoff now reports "rate limited by the vendor (429); backing off until HH:MM" with
  the real deadline instead of repeating the original failure indefinitely.
- Windows CI: the launcher's signal-forwarding and the doctor home-directory checks no longer
  assume POSIX file modes or symlink privileges are available.

### Changed
- The release workflow publishes with `npm publish --tag latest` while no stable (non-prerelease)
  version has ever shipped, since npm refuses an implicit `latest` tag for a prerelease version;
  publishes with `--provenance` over OIDC (no `NPM_TOKEN`) when the repository is public and no
  token is configured, keeping the token path as a fallback.

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- Native adapters for Claude and Codex that read credentials at call time and never refresh tokens.
- Optional Swift engine on CodexBarCore for Antigravity and additional providers.
- Local inference pools (vLLM, llama.cpp) reported as capacity with UP, BUSY and DOWN states.
- SQLite history, reset and free-reset events, pace states with a post-reset grace period.
- `headroom can` go/no-go across every meter an action consumes; `--threshold` exit codes.
- Daemon on a Unix socket, stdio MCP server, launchd and systemd service installer.
- Rejection of availability-only vendor payloads that other tools render as full meters.
